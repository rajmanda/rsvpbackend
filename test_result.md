      message: "CRITICAL ISSUE: All Maven tests are failing due to embedded MongoDB ARM64 compatibility issues. The flapdoodle embedded MongoDB library does not support MongoDB versions 5.0 or 6.0 on ARM64 architecture with Debian 12. This is a fundamental infrastructure limitation that requires either: 1) Using Testcontainers with MongoDB Docker images, 2) Using an external MongoDB instance for tests, 3) Completely mocking all MongoDB dependencies, or 4) Using a different embedded database solution. The current TestMongoConfig approach cannot work on ARM64 systems."
